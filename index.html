      <p class="one">My name is Alexander Daniel Rocha. I am 30 years old and I was born and raised in the state of New Jersey. I am currently a high school social studies teacher and an aspiring web developer. I enjoy traveling to unique places whenever I get the opportunity, collecting old history texts, playing basketball and watching soccer games. I am always looking to improve myself and learn as much as I can in order to support my family. I am proud to have a family who cheers me on and supports me.</p>

      <p class="two">My goal for this year is to complete my web developent bootcamp course and use my newly developed skiils to help middle school and high school students. Although technology use in the classroom has been growing in the last decade, I feel that the resources used by teachers and students is outdated and ineffective. Not only do I want to teach my students how to code, but I also want to develop new software programs and apps that will enhance student learning and support teachers in the classroom. I believe that anyone is capable of achieving their goals if they are willing to work hard for them and that is what I want to teach to my students.</p>
